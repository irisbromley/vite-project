# My React Playground

This is my playground to learn Vite and practice React.

## Introduction

Welcome to my React playground! This project is where I explore Vite and practice different aspects of React.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`.
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Components, State, Routing, Hooks, Testing

This playground includes pre-built components for UI practice. I can learn state management techniques, routing with React Router, hooks like useState, and write tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

Explore, experiment, and have fun while learning Vite and React!
