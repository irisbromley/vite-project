## Components

The React Playground includes a collection of pre-built components that you can use to practice building user interfaces. These components cover a wide range of functionalities and can serve as building blocks for your own projects.

## State Management

Understanding how to manage state in React is crucial for building complex applications. In this playground, you'll find examples and exercises that demonstrate various state management techniques, such as local component state, Redux, and Context API.

## Routing

React Router is a popular library used for managing navigation and routing in React applications. Within this playground, you can learn how to set up routes, handle dynamic routing, and create nested navigation structures.

## Hooks

React Hooks introduced a new way of working with state and side effects in functional components. The playground provides examples and challenges to help you familiarize yourself with hooks like useState, useEffect, useContext, and more.

## Testing

Testing is an essential part of building robust and maintainable applications. In this playground, you'll find examples and exercises for writing unit tests and integration tests for your React components using popular testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.
